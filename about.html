        <p>
          As a recent graduate, I am fully fresher in the field of software
          development. My journey started when I first discovered my passion for
          technology in high school, where I was fascinated by how software
          could solve real-world problems. This curiosity led me to pursue a
          degree in computer science, where I gained hands-on experience in
          various programming languages and development tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my last year of studies, I worked on various academic projects,
          including a Pharmacy Management System and a Placement Management
          System. These projects played a crucial role in honing my programming
          skills and deepening my understanding of software development.
